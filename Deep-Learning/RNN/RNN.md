# üìò PhD Study Guide: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

---

## üß† 1. Foundations of RNNs

* **Introduction**

  * Sequential data modeling: text, speech, time series
  * Difference from feedforward networks: memory of previous inputs
  * Key use cases: NLP, video, biosignals, music generation

* **Sequence Modeling Types**

  * One-to-One (e.g., image classification)
  * One-to-Many (e.g., image captioning)
  * Many-to-One (e.g., sentiment analysis)
  * Many-to-Many (e.g., machine translation, video classification)

* **Mathematical Formulation**

  ```
  h_t = œÉ(W_hh * h_{t-1} + W_xh * x_t + b_h)
  y_t = œÜ(W_hy * h_t + b_y)
  ```

* **Activation Functions**

  * Common: `tanh`, `sigmoid`
  * Why not ReLU (risk of exploding gradients)?

## üîÑ 2. Training RNNs

* **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**

  * RNNs are unrolled across time
  * Gradients flow backward through time steps
  * High memory & time complexity

* **Challenges**

  * **Vanishing gradients:** earlier inputs lose impact
  * **Exploding gradients:** unstable updates
  * **Long-term dependencies:** difficult to retain

* **Optimization Techniques**

  * Gradient clipping
  * Truncated BPTT (limit the number of unrolled steps)
  * Xavier / He initialization
  * Learning rate scheduling

## üîß 3. Advanced RNN Architectures

* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**

  * Gates: input, forget, output
  * Maintains **cell state** to preserve long-term info
  * Solves vanishing gradient problem

* **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**

  * Combines input & forget gates
  * Simpler, faster to train than LSTM

* **Bidirectional RNNs**

  * Processes input both forward and backward
  * Useful in language understanding

* **Deep RNNs**

  * Multiple stacked RNN layers
  * Capture more complex patterns

## üß¨ 4. RNN Variants and Extensions

* **Attention Mechanism**

  * Focus selectively on relevant parts of input
  * Soft vs hard attention
  * Introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014)

* **Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq)**

  * Separate RNNs: encoder ‚Üí context vector ‚Üí decoder
  * Foundation for translation, summarization

* **Recursive Neural Networks**

  * Tree-based input (e.g., syntactic parsing)

* **Others**

  * Clockwork RNNs (modular time steps)
  * Echo State Networks (reservoir computing)
  * Neural ODEs (continuous RNNs)

## üìä 5. Applications

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

  * Language modeling
  * Sentiment analysis
  * Named Entity Recognition
  * Machine Translation

* **Speech**

  * Phoneme classification
  * Speech-to-text
  * Speaker identification

* **Time Series**

  * Financial prediction
  * Anomaly detection
  * Sensor modeling

* **Video / Vision**

  * Action recognition
  * Gesture classification

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Tools and Frameworks

* **TensorFlow/Keras**

  * `SimpleRNN`, `LSTM`, `GRU`, `Bidirectional`

* **PyTorch**

  * `nn.RNN`, `nn.LSTM`, `nn.GRU`

* **Others**

  * TensorBoard (visualization)
  * Weights & Biases (experiment tracking)

## üìè 7. Evaluation Metrics

* **Classification Tasks**

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

* **Language Modeling**

  * Perplexity

* **Sequence Generation**

  * BLEU (translation)
  * ROUGE (summarization)
  * METEOR (alignment-based score)

---

## ü§ñ 8. RNNs vs Other Models

* **CNNs for Sequential Data**

  * 1D convolutions as alternatives for sequences

* **Transformers vs RNNs**

  * Transformers handle long-range dependencies better
  * RNNs are still useful for resource-constrained or streaming tasks

## üî¨ 9. Research Trends & Frontiers
